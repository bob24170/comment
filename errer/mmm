You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  C:\Users\88

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing your home directory as a Firebase project directory
  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory

? Are you ready to proceed? Yes
? Which Firebase features do you want to set up for this directory? Press Space to select features, then Enter to
confirm your choices. Realtime Database: Configure a security rules file for Realtime Database and (optionally)
provision default instance, Firestore: Configure security rules and indexes files for Firestore

=== Project Setup

First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add,
but for now we'll just set up a default project.

i  Using project comment-66100 (comment)

=== Database Setup
i  database: ensuring required API firebasedatabase.googleapis.com is enabled...
+  database: required API firebasedatabase.googleapis.com is enabled

? It seems like you haven’t initialized Realtime Database in your project yet. Do you want to set it up? No

Firebase Realtime Database Security Rules allow you to define how your data should be
structured and when your data can be read from and written to.

? What file should be used for Realtime Database Security Rules? database.rules.json
+  Default rules have been written to database.rules.json.
Future modifications to database.rules.json will update Realtime Database Security Rules when you run
firebase deploy.

=== Firestore Setup

Firestore Security Rules allow you to define how and when to allow
requests. You can keep these rules in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

? What file should be used for Firestore Rules? firestore.rules
? File firestore.rules already exists. Do you want to overwrite it with the Firestore Rules from the Firebase Console?
Yes

Firestore indexes allow you to perform complex queries while
maintaining performance that scales with the size of the result
set. You can keep index definitions in your project directory
and publish them with firebase deploy.

? What file should be used for Firestore indexes? firestore.indexes.json
? File firestore.indexes.json already exists. Do you want to overwrite it with the Firestore Indexes from the Firebase
Console? No

i  Writing configuration info to firebase.json...
i  Writing project information to .firebaserc...

+  Firebase initialization complete!
